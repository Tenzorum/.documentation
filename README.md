# Tenzorum Documentation

Tldr; Tenzorum is building ux infrastructure for web3. 

Aiming to help craft the best user experience there can be by any means possible.

## What are the main projects we are working on?

**Gas relayer service node protocol** â€” TSNN (Tenzorum Service Node Network)

Protocol for recieving offchain meta-transactions and executing them on behalf of users. Service nodes are compensated for this delegated transactions service. This enables a sexier new form of user experience that was previously not possible.

**Web3 Key Management SDK** - IPAS (Inter-Planetary Access System)

A SDK that is used to interface with the TSNN to use meta-transactions. Also includes other fun things such as standardised multi-sig wallets with key permissioning that uses meta-transactions, 725 identity tenzorum identity kit, universal login system, ENS subdomain factory, key recovery solutions and blockchain notifications API kit. This is essentially a fun party bag that is not only used to implement and use the TSNN but also used to implement other UX infrastructure.
