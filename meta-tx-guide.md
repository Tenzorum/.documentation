# Hitch hiker's guide to Meta-txs

## What are meta-txs?

Meta-txs are method of signing transactions that allows them to be used in a layer 2 architecture that allows for the transaction to be executed by a third party. The result is that within this layer 2 architectural setup, a private key has the potential to sign onchain transactions without ever needing gas in its account, hence achieve the 'gasless transaction'. Previously to interact and send onchain transactions, a private key would need to hold gas, this abstracts the concept of gas out of executing the transaction.

It means that a wallet, exchange, game or any application can allow people to use their systems without having to own ETH to do anything that touches the Blockchain.

If you want to learn about how this layer 2 architecture works, [read the the documentation on the TSNN](https://github.com/Tenzorum/.documentation/blob/master/TSNN.md)
